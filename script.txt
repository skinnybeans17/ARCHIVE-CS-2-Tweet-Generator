Match: Yeah, I know, she was so surprised.

Pencil: Really?

Match: Oh, for sure. I mean, it wasn't very big, just a little bug, but Flower went crazy!

Pencil: OMG, Flower is really afraid of bugs!

Match: Well yeah, Flower thinks she's so fabulous! Like the time she asked Icy if she was beautiful.

<Flashback>

Flower: Ice Cube, don't you think I look beautiful?

Ice Cube: Uhh, no...?

-Flower get angry and kicks Ice Cube in the air-

<Flashback ends>

Ice Cube: Oh oh, I remember that! I'm so gonna get revenge on her. I cannot believe how she thinks we will be her servants. I'm so glad you guys are my friends though. Really, Bubble likes me too. <uses leg to grab Bubble> Right Bubble?

Bubble: Uhh, yeah...?

Ice Cube: Riiiiiiiight? <getting Bubble close>

Match/Pencil: No! Ice Cube! Stop!

<Bubble pops and reappears in Bubble Recovery Center.>

-Pin's top goes close to her, then goes back.-

Bubble: Pin, you nearly popped me!

Pin: Oh, it's not my fault. It's this stupid Blocky here. It's his fault! <kicks Blocky and fly through air>

Blocky: UGH. <hit on ground and get up> Fine, I'll get Needle. <throws Needy at Bubble>

Needle: Help!

Bubble: <ducks and dodges> Yikes! What was that for?

Blocky: Hey, I'm just in the mood to hurt someone.

<Woody is whimper and scream, and Blocky kicks him>

Woody: <scream> <lands in ground near Teardrop.>

Leafy: <get Woody up> Woody, get up! There's a life out there to enjoy, so, enjoy it!

<Woody tries to crush Teardrop, and Teardrop kicks him.>

Tennis Ball: Teardrop, calm down. Kicking Woody could severely injure him. He is balsa.

<Woody passes Snowball who is hang gliding, and then hits Rocky. A chip falls off him and he screams.>

Eraser: I can't believe what a scaredy cat Woody is. He's so uncool. Pen though, you're cool.

Pen: So are you, Eraser.

Snowball: <hits mountain while gliding> Oof! <walk down mountain> Woah! Rocky! Wake up! <shakes Rocky>

Rocky: Wha? Hi SB!

<Snowball sighs and throws Rocky>

Rocky: Whee! Oof! <hits Tennis Ball>

Rocky: Hi TB, my good old friend.

<Spongy's squishing himself>

Firey: Coiny! You're so dumb!

<Coiny slaps him>

Firey: Hey!

Coiny: Oh my gosh, Firey! You're so easy to slap! <slaps Firey numerous times>

Golf Ball: Firey! Coiny! Stop fighting! And Spongy, take a bath, you're stinky!

Spongy: Sorrrry.

Blocky: Isn't Golf Ball bossy?

Eraser: I know! She's like a bossy bot. <Blocky,Pen and Snowball stare at Eraser.> Uhh, you know, a bossy robot? Well, a robot that was built to be its bossiest! I'd do anything to get away from her. Or Flower, or Woody, or Spongy!

Announcer: <fall from sky> Well, then you're in luck.

Eraser: Uhhh, how?

Announcer: Well, everybody, they're building the island of luxury. It's called Dream Island. A whole square mile of paradise. A 5 star hotel, A casino, 6 restaurants, Robot servants, And the winner even gets to decide who gets to come in and who doesn't.

<Flashback: Firey, Blocky and Bubble run through and Woody get slammed into Metal Door>

Eraser: So, umm, how much will it cost?

Announcer: Not even a penny.

Eraser: Then I'll take it!

Announcer: But what about everybody else? They want it too.

Eraser: Uhh, I wouldn't give up that island for anything.

Announcer: Neither would they. So we must settle this with a contest.

<Theme music>

Announcer: So, yes. Whoever stays on the bar the longest wins.

Leafy: Let's help each other!

Pin: Yeah!

Coiny: Blocky! Wake up! What are you doing?

Spongy: <falls off the bar> Uh-oh!

Flower: Out of my way! <pushes Woody, Eraser, Tennis Ball off the bar>  I need my space! <pushes Firey, Golf Ball, Needle and Leafy off the bar>

Leafy: Help me Pin!

<Pin catches and saves Leafy>

Leafy: Thanks!

Bubble: Let's form an alliance!

Match: That could do no harm!

Pencil: Let's do it!

Ice Cube: What? An alliance? I've got to join! Coming through! <knocks Pen off the bar> Sorry Pen! Hey guys, can I be part of- <slams Pencil, Match, Bubble, Snowball and herself off the bar>

Pencil: No!

Coiny: Blocky! Come on, wake up! <shakes Blocky and he falls> Oops! <but Blocky grabs on to beam and swings around, knocking Coiny off the bar>

Blocky: Coiny, don't ever... Oops!

<Final 6: Flower, Leafy, Pin, Blocky, Teardrop and Rocky>

Leafy: There's the evil Flower! She's still in.

Pin: Let's run her over!

Leafy: Yeah!

Blocky: Uh oh!

<Pin and Leafy run toward Flower, who kicks them off>

Pin: Hey! We're flying!

<Eraser appears up in the air, screaming for a short moment.>

Leafy: You're right! Woohoo!

Pin: Uh oh!

<They hit Teardrop, and they all fall>

<Teardrop and Pin grab Leafy, who grabs on to the beam>

Pin: Pull up!

Leafy: I... can't! Oh no! Blocky? Rocky? Help!

Blocky: <walk to Leafy and step on her> What is it?

Leafy: You're stepping on me!

Blocky: <moves his foot off of Leafy's hand> Better?

Leafy: Yes. Now pull us up!

<Blocky struggles to pull them up, but falls to, and grabs on to beam with feet>

Leafy: Teardrop! Hold on to my other arm!

Flower: Ha ha! I'm wearing non-slip shoes so ha! <Blocky kicks her, and she falls> Hey! Grrr... <grabs on to Pin>

Pin: Ahh! <sticks her tongue out at Flower, trying to lick her>

Flower: Wha? Eww! Oh my gosh! Uhhh... uhhh... Ahh! <falls>

Leafy: Nice going, Pin. A job well done.

Pin: Teardrop! Let's swing!

Leafy: Hughh!

<Teardrop and Pin swing up to the beam>

Pin: Yay!

Leafy: Pin, alliance, remember?

Pin: Oh yeah! <brings Leafy up, and Leafy lands on Blocky's foot who starts slipping>

Blocky: Leafy! You're stepping on me! <falls>

Leafy: Wha...? Oops!

<Final 4: Pin, Rocky, Teardrop and Leafy>

<Teardrop starts running toward Rocky to push him off and he falls, but Teardrop falls too>

<Final 2: Pin and Leafy>

Leafy/Pin: Rock, Paper, Scissors! <Leafy picks Paper and Pin picks Scissors>

Pin: Scissors beats paper! I get to push you off!

Leafy: Wait, hold on a sec! We didn't agree to that!

Pin: Look, when I win the island, I'll let you on to the island.

Leafy: Pin! This still isn't fair!

Pin: Only 1 of us can win.

Leafy: Um, Pin? Wrong finger.

Pin: Whoops! He he... Anyway! Still, only 1 of us can win.

Announcer: That's where you're wrong. The 2 of you both win.

Pin: Wait, we both get the island?

Announcer: Nope! You just get to choose the teams. The teams for a much larger, longer battle to win Dream Island.

Pin: Oh great!

Leafy: It's not that bad...
